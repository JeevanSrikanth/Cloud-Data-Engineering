2. What is BIGDATA ?
    1. 'Big Data' is also a data but with a huge size.
    2. 'Big Data' is nothing but the huge amount of data which cannot be stored & processed by traditional systems such as RDBMS
    3. It is stated that almost 90% of today's data has been generated in the past few years.

3. Categories of BIGDATA ?   
    1. Structured
    2. Unstructured
    3. Semi-structured

6. Traditional RDBMS vs. Hadoop
    1. Storage limit
    2. Varieties
    3. Cost of software
    4. Processing type
    5. Cost of hardware
    6. Source code
7. History of Hadoop?
    1. Doug cutting is the founder of Hadoop
    2. Doug cutting named it as Hadoop after his son’s toy elephant name.
    3. He published below 2 white papers:
        1. Google File System(GFS) in 2003
        2. MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters in 2004
8. What is Hadoop ?
    1. An open source project from the apache software foundation
    2. It provides a software framework for distributing and running applications on cluster of servrs
    3. It is inspired by Google map reducing Model as well as its file system(GFS)
    4. Haddop was orginally written for the nutch search engine project
    5. Hadoop is open source framework written in Java
    6. It efficiently process large volumes of data on a cluster of commodity hardware
    7. Hadoop can be setup on single machine, but real power of hadoop comes with a cluster of machines, it can be scaled from single machine to thousands of machines on the fly.
